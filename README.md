# Lane Splitter

## High-speed urban racing: weave through dense highway traffic, outmaneuver a rival AI, and set record times.

"Lane Splitter" is a thrilling arcade racing game where players navigate a busy urban highway, skillfully driving between cars at high speeds while competing against a challenging AI opponent. The primary goal is to achieve the fastest lap time on a demanding highway course, with times recorded on a scoreboard. Featuring realistic car models, dynamic traffic, and engaging drifting mechanics, the game offers an immersive urban racing experience.
